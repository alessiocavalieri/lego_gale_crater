# Description

It's a set of LEGO compatible baseplates, with two plate dimensions: 10x10 pins (80x80 mm) and 20x20 pins (160x160 mm)

They are designed to fit with regular LEGO bricks in order to create a martian terrain scenery.

# Designing

I have downloaded the STL scan of the Gale Crater from 

https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/gale-crater

and created all around with Blender, adding the base and the LEGO pins, the 20x20 pins version has 4 auxiliary pins for put a a flag on the crater.

The decimate modifier is used in order to reduce the numbers of the polygons from the NASA gale crater scan.

# Printing advice

I have printed the models with: 

  * 0.4 mm nozzle
  * 0.2 mm layer height
  * 30% infill
  * 6 perimeters (2.4 wall thickness)

I advice to use a 30% infill setting for better finishing of the crater surface.
